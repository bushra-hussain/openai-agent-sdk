# Calculator Code Explanation

## Code Explanation

1. **Imports and Definitions**:
    - The script begins with a simple module-level docstring to describe its purpose.

2. **Functions**:
    - `add(x, y)`: This function returns the sum of `x` and `y`.
    - `subtract(x, y)`: This function returns the result of subtracting `y` from `x`.
    - `multiply(x, y)`: This function returns the product of `x` and `y`.
    - `divide(x, y)`: This function returns the quotient of `x` divided by `y`. It raises an error if `y` is zero to prevent division by zero.

3. **Main Function**:
    - Prints operation choices: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
    - Continuously prompts user input for operation choice and numbers.
    - Validates whether the chosen operation is valid.
    - Calls appropriate function based on user's choice and prints the result.
    - Handles division by zero by catching the `ValueError`.

4. **Execution**:
    - The script checks if it's run directly (`if __name__ == "__main__":`). If so, it calls `main()`.
